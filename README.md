##### What is Mancala?
Mancala is a two-player strategy game where players take turns moving stones between small cups or pits in the board. The game is played on a board with 14 cups or pits, 12 small ones and 2 large ones called Mancalas. The cups are arranged in two rows with six cups in each row. The Mancalas are located at the end of each row.

At the beginning of the game, four stones are placed in each of the small cups. Each player controls one row of cups and the Mancala at their right.

The object of the game is to collect the most stones in your Mancala.

On your turn, you choose a cup from your row that has stones and distribute those stones one at a time counter-clockwise into the other cups.

If your last stone lands in your Mancala, you get to take another turn. If your last stone lands in an empty cup on your side, you capture all the stones from the opposite cup into your Mancala. The game ends when one player no longer has stones in their row. The remaining stones are captured by the other player. The player with the most stones in their Mancala at the end of the game wins.
